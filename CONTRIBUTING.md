# About contributions

Thank you for contributing to the Hubble ecosystem! We immensly appreciate any effort made by open source contributors and welcome contributions of all sorts!

Before submitting your contribution to one of our Hubble core-team members for review, we would like to ask you to read the contribution guidelines and make sure you have aligned your contribution with them.
We believe in Hubble as an open source effort, but to make this possible we need some ground rules in place in order to ensure easy review, code quality and clear communication.

Thank you âœ¨

## Code of Conduct

Please do not violate the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/inthepocket/hubble-oss-launchpad/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## Development guidelines

- Introducing new dependencies should and will go through a review process. We carefully pick our dependencies and weigh out its pros and cons.
- If you are adding a feature, try and keep the code changes contained to your feature. Retroactively changing pieces of code that are out of scope or unrelated to your feature might have an impact on performance, visibility or possible bugs.

## Git guidelines

- Familiarize yourself to [Git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) and please adhere to it.
- Please do not rebase, squash, force-push or rewrite your code in any way possible. We have decided to use merge commits (via Github PR) for getting code in our codebase.

## Versioning

- We use the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec and all versions should be bumped according to it.
