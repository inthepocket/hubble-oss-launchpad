# About contributions

Thank you for contributing to the Hubble ecosystem! We immensly appreciate any effort made by open source contributors and welcome contributions of all sorts!

Before submitting your contribution to one of our Hubble core-team members for review, we would like to ask you to read the contribution guidelines and make sure you have aligned your contribution with them.
We believe in Hubble as an open source effort, but to make this possible we need some ground rules in place in order to ensure easy review, code quality and good communication.

Thank you âœ¨
